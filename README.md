There once was a man named Mickey Who grew lots of weed that was sticky He wanted to sell his empire But that sparked a lot of fire From gangsters and thugs who were tricky

 

They tried to blackmail and bribe him They tried to rob and outsmart him But Mickey was clever and tough He knew how to deal with their bluff He had his loyal Ray to guide him
